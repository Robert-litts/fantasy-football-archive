# Fantasy Football Archive

Go-based RESTful API for accessing historical fantasy football data. The data was retrieved from the ESPN using [cwendt94's espn-api](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api) and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The API lets you query past fantasy football league data, including league standings, team performance, drafts, and more.
